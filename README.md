This dashboard brings a whole new version of self-hosting. This project brings several possibilities like connecting a Pterodactyl or Proxmox API to manage your services for you and your customers. A simple payment system based on PayPal and others allows you to manage your customers' invoices, payments and late payments, by suspending their services automatically in the event of delay.
