This dashboard brings a whole new version of self-hosting. This project brings several possibilities like connecting a Pterodactyl or Proxmox API to manage your services for you and your customers. A simple payment system based on PayPal and others allows you to manage your customers' invoices, payments and late payments, by suspending their services automatically in the event of delay.

### **And a lot of other features in TODO list:**
 - [x] A modern design
 - [x] Easy connection to different APIs
 - [x] Community plugin system
 - [x] Automatic mailing
 - [x] Announcement system
 - [x] Maintenance and intervention system
 - [x] Secure authentication system based on encrypted tokens
 - [ ] Ticket and alert system
 - [ ] PDF generation for invoices
 - [ ] And more in the next updates
